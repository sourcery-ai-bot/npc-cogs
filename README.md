**Note: I'm taking a break from coding and won't be available in the cog support server or the main server.  
All the cogs are functional and is actively used by me, any kind of suggestions/bugfixes are always welcome in the form of issues or PRs.  
Any doubts regarding setup can either be asked in my DMs or an issue can be opened in this repo.**

A fun oriented list of Red-Cogs made for fun ofc.
